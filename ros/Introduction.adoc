== ROS Introduction

=== An introduction
As a requirement from the product owner, *ROS* is used as framework on Willy. ROS, the Robot 
Operating System, is a flexible software *framework* for use in robots. It consists of a 
collection of libraries, tools and conventions that provide basic infrastructure to 
communicate between different parts of the robot.

In the case of Willy, ROS is especially handy because Willy is made with a modular design. 
All modules can be removed without disrupting the other functionalities of Willy. 
For example, when the web interface is removed, Willy is still able to drive, but 
with another module as for example the keyboard controller. Or the removal of the motor 
driver makes Willy still able to interact with public.

=== Nodes
A *node* in ROS can be seen as a module. It is an executable that communicates through ROS 
to other nodes to send and receive data. A node can be for example a c++ application, or 
a piece of Python code, or even an Arduino connected with USB running code. A piece of 
information a node receives or sends is called a *message*.

=== Topics
A topic is a bus over which nodes can exchange data messages. A topic always has a name so that all topics can be identified clearly.

To interact with a topic, two methods are used, subscribing and publishing.

==== Subscribing
*Subscribing* is getting data from a topic. This does require the topic to be published first. 
Each time a message is published on this topic, a message 
will be passed to all subscribing nodes containing the data within. This way a node can use this information. 

For example, the move_base node will publish a message on the topic `/cmd_vel` with accerelation values. The motor controller is subscribed to this topic and will thus read the acceleration values, letting the robot move appropriately.

==== Publishing
*Publishing* is sending data to a topic. Upon starting a node, it will create the associated topics and start publishing information upon these topics. Whenever a node has new information, a message will 
automatically be sent to the linked topic(s), upon which the subscribers will receive and process the message.
