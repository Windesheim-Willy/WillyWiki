==== Background
The previous group has also done research on a LIDAR sensor.
Unfortunately the previous documentation stated that it was not possible
to link a LIDAR to ROS. Also other methods where somehow researched by a
previous group but not in the form of a LIDAR. (Research localization
system v1.1, 2017)

A LIDAR sensor uses a laser to measure distance. With these measurements
the sensor makes a map of all the objects in the environment.

The previous group has done some research concerning LIDAR and the link to
ROS. But came to the conclusion that it is not possible to create a link
between LIDAR and ROS. Therefore they decided to not implement the LIDAR
sensor.

After doing some research we found that it is possible and supported to link ROS to a LIDAR sensor.

At this stage we use the LIDAR to navigate with Willy. The sensor is 
placed at the front of the robot.

The LIDAR is connected with an Ethernet connection via a router to the pc.
