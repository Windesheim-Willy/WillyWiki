== New ROS master on Lubuntu for Multimaster node for Willy

Because Multimaster is not available for Raspbian, node master node of Willy will be using Lubuntu.
ROS.org states that the best way is to use a pre-installed version http://wiki.ros.org/ROSberryPi/Installing%20ROS%20Kinetic%20on%20the%20Raspberry%20Pi


An SD Card Image with Ubuntu 16.04 (LXDE) and ROS Kinetic installed can be downloaded here for the Raspberry Pi 3. The here refers to:
https://downloads.ubiquityrobotics.com/ On this site the left button is chosen. This brings to https://downloads.ubiquityrobotics.com/pi.html.

For Willy the latest version (2018-11-15-ubiquity-xenial-lxde) is choosen: https://cdn.ubiquityrobotics.net/2018-11-15-ubiquity-xenial-lxde-raspberry-pi.img.xz

The SD image is also stored on the SharePoint site of Willy.

The image is flashed to the 16 GB SD card with Rufus 3.4, but any flash program can be used.

The standard user on the node is ubuntu with the password ubuntu as is stated on the site of the supplier.

The following adjustments to the image are made:
To ensure that the startup scripts from the supplier are disabled:
----
sudo systemctl disable magni-base
