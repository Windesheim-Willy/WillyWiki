== The start of Willy

=== The birth of an idea

In 2015 a 'waste competition' was organized at a primary school, with the aim to provide the 
pupils of this primary school with a solution to the question 'how to keep the Grote Markt in 
Zwolle clean'. Eventually, six students won this competition with their idea to keep the Grote 
Markt clean with the help of a 'cleaning robot (Willy)'. An important aspect of Willy had to 
be that he would be able to interact with bystanders and thus influence them on their waste 
behavior. For example, Willy might point out to people that it would be better to deposit 
waste in a waste bin instead of throwing it on the floor; this would enable Willy to 
influence people positively. In short, Willy must be able to act in a corrective as well as 
a preventive (i.e. interaction) manner.

The primary school contacted the township of Zwolle to see if the 'Willy concept' could be 
realized. The township of Zwolle reacted positively to the Willy concept and then looked 
into whether it could involve a partner who could take on Willy's realization.

Eventually the township of Zwolle found 'The Art of Robotics (TAoR)'; a foundation 
that works to increase the awareness of robot technology in today's society. ' The team of 
TAoR responded enthusiastically to this proposition and subsequently made a plan on how they 
could best realize Willy. Ruud van der Burg contacted Hogeschool Windesheim on behalf of 
TAoR with the proposal to see if it would be possible to let students (of different 
disciplines) work at Willy. Windesheim agreed to this, with which the realization process 
of Willy started.
