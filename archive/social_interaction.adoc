== Social interaction
The social interaction creates the interaction of Willy. He listens and speaks with people.

The social interaction is build with NodeJS. NodeJS has a webserver and connects with web sockets to the front-end of Willy. The NodeJS server processes all information of the interactions and passes this to the front-end. The front-end doesn't contains any logic of the social interaction, only the logic of displaying information to the website.
