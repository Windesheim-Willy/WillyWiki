== Radeffect App
Together with another group of Windesheim students an app was developed for Willy. The app is developed in Mendix.
The application can be found here: https://callwilly-sandbox.mxapps.io/ The main function of the app is to call Willy over. This is done by:

Post:

* Retrieving from Willy topics the location (AprilTag number) and activity
* Converting the ArpilTag number to the classroom number
* Publishing the location (classroom number) and activity of Willy in Json format to the Mendix App site

Get:

* Retrieving the designated location (classroom number) when a visitor calls for Willy in Json format from the Mendix app site
* Converting the classroom number to AprilTag number
* Publishing the AprilTag number on a Willy topic

The activities are done in two Python scripts published here: https://github.com/Windesheim-Willy/Skylab/blob/master/Fetcher/Skylab_app_get_status_0.py and https://github.com/Windesheim-Willy/Skylab/blob/master/Fetcher/Skylab_app_post_status_0.py

For test purposes a test script is created to publish every 10 seconds a new location and activity so the app can work without Willy being active. The script is published here: https://github.com/Windesheim-Willy/Skylab/blob/master/Fetcher/Test_script_for_RADeffect.py

The scripts for Radeffect connectivity are run on the Fetcher in Skylab.

A backup of the Mendix code is stored on SharePoint at the map "Winnie App".
