== Multi master setup on Willy 

The Willy environment is built on two locations (Willy and Skylab) which are coupled with an Wi-fi connection. By using an multi master set up there are two advantages: 

* Through the set up it can be decided which topics will be transferred between the two environments, thereby potentially saving bandwidth (configured on master_sync node) 
* Skylab will have a dedicated master even when Willy is not operational 

To have the sync module always up-and-running, it seems that this module will be running on the master in Skylab. It has to be tested if the master on Willy will be automatically be recognized when it is started or some actions has to be taken. Seems to be a task of the master_discovery node. 

It has to be tested in the Willy environment if this set up works. Actions are: 

* [*] Make snapshot of test master in Skylab 
* [*] Install multimaster on the (now) test master in Skylab 
* [*] Install test master with multimaster on a RPi 
* [*] Confirm that it works 
* [*] Evaluate the stop and restart of master on RPI and document possible restart actions 

_Go/no go decision_ 

Go: 

* [ ] Install multimaster on production RPi on Willy 
* [ ] Depreciate test master on RPi 
* [ ] Document and make instructions 

No go: 

* [*] Revert snapshot on master in Skylab 
* [*] Make decision on further action  

*Decision is that the nodes in Skylab will be using the ROS master of Willy.*

=== Installation and using multimaster

Install multimaster on every master Kinetic node with: 

* sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-multimaster-fkie 
* Check DNS, localhost and host name 
* Enable multicast feature on both hosts and for all ROS nodes: 
** edit the /etc/sysctl.conf file and add the following line: 
*** net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts=0 

Start multi master: 

* first master: 
** export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://brainnode:11311  
** roscore >/dev/null 2>&1 & 
** rosrun master_discovery_fkie master_discovery >/dev/null 2>&1 & 
** rosrun master_sync_fkie master_sync >/dev/null 2>&1 & 

* second master: 
** export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://u1634:11312 
** roscore --port 11312 >/dev/null 2>&1 & 
** rosrun master_discovery_fkie master_discovery >/dev/null 2>&1 & 
** rosrun master_sync_fkie master_sync >/dev/null 2>&1 & 

=== For info: 

* start node manager with: node_manager 
* rosservice call /master_discovery/list_masters 

Take note: there must be a binding between the IP address and the host name for all the computers in all the networks in order for the ROS framework to work properly.
