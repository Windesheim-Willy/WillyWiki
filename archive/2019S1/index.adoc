=== Main tasks
Our goals for this semester were to fix the autonomous driving, create a manual for future groups and to clean out any files that are not used. A common occurring problem is that
project groups have a hard time starting this project. A lot of vague documentation and a lot of outdated features create a lot of confusion. To fix this problem we have decided to
create a manual to help future groups get started.
