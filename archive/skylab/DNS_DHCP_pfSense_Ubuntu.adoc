== DNS, DHCP, pfSense and Ubuntu

When the Ubuntu systems are configured with static DHCP from pfSense, they get the correct IP adress.
But they don't get a external nameserver, so they can't connect to the outside World.
Therefore all the Ubuntu systems have an manually added nameserver of 8.8.8.8.
