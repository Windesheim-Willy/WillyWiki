== Speech recognition
Listening to speech is located on the SI node and is done with a Python script.
The script is published at the Github location: https://github.com/Windesheim-Willy/speech_recognition/blob/master/start_recognition.py .
Two essential services are used:

* Speech recognition (speech to text conversion) of Google through the use the module speech_recognition
* Fuzzy logic search option through the use of the module fuzzywuzzy

== Flow
The general flow in the script is as follows:

* The neccesary modules are imported
* The hit ratio used for fuzzy logic resemblance is set
* Two topics are set for publishing
* Speech is captured through the microphone
* Speech is transferred to Google for translation in clear text in Dutch
* Text is published on topic /interaction/clear_text
* Text is compared with fuzzy logic to keywords, when hit the number 1 is published on topic /interaction/is_active
